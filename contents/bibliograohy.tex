\begin{frame}{\TeX, \LaTeX, and Beamer} \justifying
\TeX\ is a programming language for the typesetting of documents. It was created by Donald Erwin Knuth in the late 1970s and it is documented in \emph{The \TeX book}~\cite{knuth1984texbook}.

\bigskip

In the early 1980s, Leslie Lamport created the initial version of \LaTeX, a high-level language on top of \TeX, which is documented in \emph{\LaTeX{}: A Document Preparation System}~\cite{lamport1994latex}. There exists a healthy ecosystem of packages that extend the base functionality of \LaTeX; \emph{The \LaTeX{} Companion}~\cite{mittelbach2004latex} acts as a guide through the ecosystem.

In 2003, Till Tantau created the initial version of Beamer, a \LaTeX{} package for the creation of presentations. Beamer is documented in the \emph{User's Guide to the Beamer Class}~\cite{tantau2004user}.
